        "#As a data scientist, the first step in any project is to collect relevant and structured data. In this exercise, your task is to extract job-related information from the RemoteOK job website: [https://remoteok.com/r](https://remoteok.com/r).\n",

        "#- Use Python along with libraries such as `requests`, `pandas`, and optionally `json` or `BeautifulSoup` if needed.\n",
        "#- Retrieve the job data from the RemoteOK API or web page.\n",
        "#- Parse the JSON or HTML response to extract the required fields.\n",
